# auto-Scanning-Electron-Microscope-that-reconstructs-3D-models-of-brain-tissue
Very low cost automatic Scanning-Electron-Microscope that reconstructs 3D models of brain tissue samples. Supervised by my mentor Dr. Yu Sun. He is the Canada Research Chair in Micro and Nano Engineering Systems

Built the control system using C# and .NET frame. Programmed 4 microcontrollers to perform the sample slicing through TCP, and construct 3D maps in the control terminal with e-microscope photos. Image deep learning is based on CNN.
